# Introduction

This is just some code to read and store some sensor value (DHT22, temperature and humidity) to a google spreadsheet from a Raspberry Pi

# Usage

The python file is for uploading the data fields to google docs. 
measurement.sh is called by a cronjob and reads sensor data with help from loldht(a compiled file from https://github.com/technion/lol_dht22).
